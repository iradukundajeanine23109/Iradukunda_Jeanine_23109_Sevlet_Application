1.What is Logging?
Logging refers to the practice of recording information about the execution of a program.
2. Why Logging is Important
Debugging and Troubleshooting: Logs provide insights into what is happening inside an application,
which helps developers diagnose and fix issues. When errors occur, logs can reveal the sequence of events leading up to the problem.
Monitoring and Performance: Logs can be used to monitor the application's performance and health. They can track resource usage,
execution time of specific operations, and other metrics that help in optimizing and scaling the application.
Auditing and Compliance: In many applications, especially those handling sensitive data, logging is essential for auditing purposes.
Security: Logs can help detect and investigate security incidents. They can record unauthorized access attempts, suspicious activities, and other security-related events.
Documentation: Logs serve as a historical record of an application's behavior over time, providing valuable documentation for understanding its functionality and changes.
3.Understanding Logging Levels
Logging levels help categorize the severity and importance of log messages. They allow you to control the granularity of information that gets logged.
